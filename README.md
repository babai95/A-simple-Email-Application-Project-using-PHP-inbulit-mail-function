# A-simple-Email-Application-Project-using-PHP-inbulit-mail-function
Here a simple Email Application is made where there is only 1 admin user and that user can send mail to all other users in the admin's mailing list
There are 2 options: compose mail and remove mail. In compose mail, the admin user can send mail to all other users in the admin's mailing list. In remove mail, the admin user can remove an email account from its mailing list and hence that person's account will be removed from the admin user's mailing list.
